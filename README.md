# ProjectA_MovieLens

This project implements a Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR) model from scratch to make movie recommendations to a random group. 


## Project structure

* BPR_with_weights.py contain the core stucture of the model.
* BPR_trainval_with_weights.py is the file used to start the training of the model. 
* BPR_use_leastmisery.py contains the strategy that we ended up using for our project, when the model had been trained.

To see our results, you can run the BPR_use_leastmisery.py file. 

To run all three files the required libraries are the following:
* numpy
* pandas
* scipy
* tqdm
* pickle
* random
* collections
